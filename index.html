      This is my notebook for the Primer series at Portland Code School. It collects terms, definitions, journal entries, and at least one picture of my face.

        <h2>My Goals</h2>
        <p>Being self taught in anything is bound to result in small random gaps in knowledge. My goal for this class is to fill in those gaps. I also need to learn some best practices because it's never easy to know if you're doing something badly if it
          works.
        </p>
        <p>
          I also lack the soft skills required to be a good developper. I'm taking this class to get experience working with other people, get the hang of git in a teamwork setting, and learn to communicate better.
        </p>
        <p>
          I want to work with other people on this thing I've mostly done on my own.

        <h2>My Concerns</h2>
        <p>There are lots of things I don't know. There will always be lots of things I don't know. I'm the kind of person who likes to know everything I possibly can and knowing the sheer size of my ignorance is intimidating.</p>
        <p>
          My single biggest concern is that I've never worked on anything but my own projects and I'm worried I like learning to code more than I like coding.
